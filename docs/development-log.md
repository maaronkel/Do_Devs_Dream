## Halfway Thoughts

This is essentially the half way point of my project unfortunately, as I didn't plan as well as I know I should've. Not that I didn't do the documentation or diagram first etc, more so that I bit off more than I could chew in terms of time contraints and my comfortability with Ruby at the moment. 

It took me a while to get started as I kept re-editing the control flow diagram to something that would be achievable for me by the deadline of the assignment.

I kept getting too carried away with thinking of more and more features I wanted to add, then adding them to the flowchart, and realising I wouldn't have time for half of them in the week time frame (even less since I didn't start properly planning till  essentially Wednesday).

However if the Control Flow Diagram and SDP were basically finished by Wednesday/ Thursday, and I had a clear idea of what I could achieve, I would have given myself more time to potentially add the features I want, gain a better understanding of some OOP concepts as well as more testing and refactoring.

This is definitely something I'm going to learn from for future projects, as I know what I should have done differently, however I'm still confident to finish the project by Monday the 27th.

- **Sunday** *Night* - Finish coding the test.rb with question and answer loop + Code info.rb + Write more tests with Rspec + Start t apply DRY coding principles
- **Monday** - Finish rspec testing + Modularize code + Code Help and Info section + Code the glitch animation and Meter + Add the screenshots of Trello to the SDP + add gems + create help file and shell script + make the presentation
